Common guidelines:
1) do not do traceroute from the routers and gateways
2) "show ip interface brief" - is the command to be used in ios router for seeing the interface up/down status. Do not use this command on the ios as it does not exist 'show interfaces status'
3) Make sure to check if the interfaces have the IPs as mentioned in the topology. Consider the topology to be the single source of truth for the IP addressing.
4) Make sure to verify the ip routes after any network change is performed
5) Do only a single network change
