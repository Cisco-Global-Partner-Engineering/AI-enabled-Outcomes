"### Summary of Key Findings and Potential Issues from 'branch-switch' Analysis\n\n#### 1. **VLAN Configuration and Segmentation**\n- **All primary interfaces (Gi0/0, Gi0/1, Gi0/2)** are assigned to **VLAN 1 (default VLAN)**, which is active and up.\n- **VLAN 99 (management)** exists and is assigned only to Gi0/3, which is not part of the main user/data traffic path.\n- **No custom VLANs** are configured for client, server, or DMZ segmentation; all user/data traffic traverses VLAN 1.\n- **No trunking or VLAN segmentation** is implemented; all main interfaces are in the same broadcast domain (VLAN 1).\n- **No evidence of VLAN misconfiguration** (e.g., missing VLANs, inactive VLANs, or ports assigned to the wrong VLAN) for the main traffic path.\n\n#### 2. **Interface Status and Configuration**\n- **All relevant physical interfaces (Gi0/0, Gi0/1, Gi0/2)** are **up/up** and not administratively down.\n- **No Layer 3 addressing** is configured on these interfaces, as expected for a Layer 2 switch.\n- **No evidence of interface shutdowns, protocol failures, or physical link issues** on the interfaces involved in the user/data traffic path.\n- **Disabled ports (Gi1/0\u2013Gi1/3)** are not in use and do not impact the relevant traffic path.\n\n#### 3. **MAC Address Table Analysis**\n- **VLAN 1:** MAC addresses are learned on Gi0/0, Gi0/1, and Gi0/2.\n- **VLAN 99:** MAC addresses are learned only on Gi0/3.\n- **No MAC address associated with 10.1.0.2 (remote-worker)** or its next-hop interface is present in the MAC address table.\n- **Expected behavior:** For traffic to/from remote-worker, MAC addresses should be learned on the port facing the branch-router/firewall (likely Gi0/0 or Gi0/1), but none are present.\n\n#### 4. **Alarm Trigger Context**\n- **100% packet loss** is observed when pinging 10.1.0.2 (remote-worker) from multiple internal hosts.\n- **Other internal-to-internal/server pings succeed**, indicating the issue is isolated to the remote-worker path.\n- **No evidence of VLAN or interface anomalies** that would selectively block only remote-worker traffic while allowing other traffic to pass.\n\n---\n\n## **Potential Issues Identified**\n\n### **A. Absence of MAC Learning for Remote-Worker Path**\n- **Issue:** The MAC address table does not show any MAC address associated with the remote-worker (10.1.0.2) or its gateway on any port.\n- **Implications:**\n  - Indicates that no traffic is traversing the switch for that destination.\n  - Could be due to a link issue (physical or logical) on the path to the remote-worker.\n  - Could also be due to VLAN misconfiguration (if the port connecting to the remote-worker path is not in the correct VLAN, MAC learning would not occur).\n- **Remediation Steps:**\n  1. **Check the physical and logical status** of the port(s) connecting to the branch-router/firewall (likely Gi0/0 or Gi0/1).\n  2. **Verify VLAN assignment** on these ports to ensure they are in VLAN 1 (or the correct VLAN for remote-worker traffic).\n  3. **Check for port security or filtering** (e.g., ACLs, port security) that might block MAC learning or traffic.\n  4. **Test connectivity** from the switch to the next-hop device (branch-router/firewall) using tools like CDP/LLDP neighbors and interface counters.\n  5. **Clear the MAC address table** and attempt to generate traffic to see if MAC learning occurs.\n\n### **B. VLAN 99 Assignment Anomaly**\n- **Issue:** At least one interface is configured as an access port in VLAN 99, which is not referenced as a relevant user/data VLAN in the topology.\n- **Implications:**\n  - If a critical interface is incorrectly assigned to VLAN 99, and VLAN 99 is not trunked or present elsewhere, traffic could be isolated or dropped.\n  - This could result in connectivity failures such as the observed 100% packet loss to the remote-worker.\n- **Remediation Steps:**\n  1. **Audit all interface VLAN assignments** to ensure only management ports are in VLAN 99.\n  2. **Ensure all user/data traffic ports** are assigned to the correct VLAN (VLAN 1, per current configuration).\n  3. **Check for accidental VLAN assignment changes** on critical interfaces.\n\n### **C. Lack of VLAN Segmentation**\n- **Issue:** All user/data traffic traverses VLAN 1; there is no segmentation for different roles (client, server, DMZ).\n- **Implications:**\n  - While not directly causing the current issue, this is a security and best-practice concern. Any VLAN-related outage would affect all traffic.\n- **Remediation Steps:**\n  1. **Plan and implement VLAN segmentation** for different network roles to improve security and fault isolation.\n  2. **Update switch and trunk configurations** accordingly.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table of Key Issues and Remediation**\n\n| Issue                                      | Evidence/Details                                                                 | Potential Impact                        | Remediation Steps                                                                                  |\n|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| No MAC learning for remote-worker path      | No MAC for 10.1.0.2 or its gateway in MAC table                                  | Loss of connectivity to remote-worker   | Check port status, VLAN assignment, port security, test connectivity, clear MAC table, retest     |\n| VLAN 99 assignment anomaly                  | At least one interface in VLAN 99, not used for user/data traffic                | Possible traffic isolation/drop         | Audit VLAN assignments, ensure only management ports in VLAN 99, correct misassigned interfaces   |\n| Lack of VLAN segmentation                   | All user/data traffic in VLAN 1                                                  | Security, fault isolation risk          | Plan/implement VLAN segmentation, update switch/trunk configs                                     |\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\n- **No direct VLAN or interface misconfiguration** is evident for the main user/data path (all relevant ports are up and in VLAN 1).\n- **Critical Issue:** The absence of MAC learning for the remote-worker path suggests a Layer 2 forwarding or connectivity problem, possibly due to a link issue, VLAN misassignment, or port security/filtering.\n- **Secondary Issue:** Ensure no critical interfaces are misassigned to VLAN 99, which could isolate traffic.\n- **Action:** Focus immediate troubleshooting on the physical/logical status and VLAN assignment of the port(s) connecting to the remote-worker path, and verify MAC learning and traffic forwarding for that segment."
