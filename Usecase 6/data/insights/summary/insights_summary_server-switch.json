"### Summary of Key Findings\n\nAfter analyzing all provided insights for the device **'server-switch'**, the following conclusions and observations can be made:\n\n---\n\n#### 1. **VLAN Configuration**\n- **VLAN 4 (\"SERVER_NET\")** is active and correctly assigned to **Gi0/1** (server) and **Gi0/3** (DMZ firewall).\n- No unexpected ports are present in VLAN 4.\n- No inactive or missing VLANs relevant to the server path.\n- **VLAN 99** is present and assigned to Gi0/0 (likely for management), but is not involved in user/data traffic.\n\n#### 2. **Interface Status**\n- All physical interfaces (**Gi0/0 to Gi0/3**) are **administratively and operationally up** (Status: up, Protocol: up).\n- No interfaces are down or showing errors.\n- No Layer 3 IP addresses are assigned to physical interfaces, as expected for a Layer 2 switch.\n- **Vlan99** interface is up with a management IP, not relevant to the alarm.\n\n#### 3. **Port Membership and VLAN Assignments**\n- **Gi0/1** and **Gi0/3** are in VLAN 4 (server and DMZ firewall connections).\n- **Gi0/0** is in VLAN 99 (management).\n- **Gi0/2** is in VLAN 1 (default, not relevant to alarm).\n- No trunk ports or VLAN mismatches indicated.\n\n#### 4. **MAC Address Table**\n- For **VLAN 4**, only two MAC addresses are learned:\n    - `5254.0006.7753` on **Gi0/3** (DMZ firewall)\n    - `5254.000a.004a` on **Gi0/1** (server)\n- No MAC addresses for VLAN 4 are learned on other ports.\n- No MAC flapping, missing MACs, or anomalies in MAC learning.\n\n#### 5. **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**\n- No ACLs (standard, extended, or named) are configured or applied to any interface.\n- No evidence of interface shutdowns, errors, or misconfigurations.\n\n#### 6. **Alarm Context Correlation**\n- The alarm is for **100% packet loss to 10.1.0.2 (remote-worker)** from all sources.\n- **Pings to local subnets (10.0.2.10, 10.0.3.10, 10.0.4.10) are successful**.\n- The 'server-switch' is functioning normally for all local traffic and its Layer 2 forwarding.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Issues Identified\n\n**No direct issues or misconfigurations were found on 'server-switch' that would explain the alarm (loss of connectivity to 10.1.0.2).** Specifically:\n\n- **No VLAN misconfiguration:** All relevant ports are in the correct VLANs.\n- **No interface errors or down states:** All interfaces are up and operational.\n- **No MAC learning issues:** MAC addresses are learned as expected on the correct ports.\n- **No ACLs or security features blocking traffic:** No ACLs are present.\n- **No evidence of Layer 2 forwarding problems:** The MAC address table is normal.\n\n#### **Notable Observations (but not issues):**\n- **VLAN 99** is present and active, but only used for management and not involved in the alarm context.\n- **Gi0/2** is in VLAN 1, but this port is not involved in the server or DMZ firewall path.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table of Checks**\n\n| Check Area         | Status/Findings                                 | Issues? |\n|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| VLAN Assignment    | Correct for all relevant ports                  | No      |\n| Interface Status   | All up, no errors                              | No      |\n| MAC Table          | Correct learning, no anomalies                 | No      |\n| ACLs               | None present                                   | No      |\n| Trunking           | Not relevant, all access ports                 | No      |\n| Management VLAN    | Present, not affecting user/data traffic       | No      |\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion & Recommendations**\n\n- **No issues were found on 'server-switch'** that would explain the alarm of 100% packet loss to 10.1.0.2.\n- The switch is functioning as expected for all Layer 2 operations relevant to the server and DMZ firewall.\n- **Remediation Steps:**  \n    - Since the 'server-switch' is not the source of the problem, focus troubleshooting on:\n        - The **DMZ firewall** (connected to Gi0/3), as it is the next hop for traffic leaving the server subnet.\n        - **Routing or firewall rules** between the server subnet and the remote-worker subnet (10.1.0.2).\n        - **Network path beyond the server-switch**, especially devices responsible for inter-VLAN or inter-subnet routing.\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe 'server-switch' is not exhibiting any configuration or operational issues that would cause the reported connectivity loss. The problem likely lies further along the network path, possibly at the DMZ firewall or in the routing/firewall configuration between the server subnet and the remote-worker subnet."
