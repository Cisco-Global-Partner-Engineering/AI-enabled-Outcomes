            "Alarm Summary": "Critical network outage caused by a downed interface and missing static routes, resulting in total loss of connectivity to the remote-worker subnet; resolved by restoring the interface on the branch-router.",
            "Device Family": "Routers",
            "Classification": "Urgent",
            "Reason": "Administratively down interface on branch-router.",
            "Recommended Actions": "1. Bring up any administratively down interfaces on critical network devices (e.g., use `no shutdown` on affected interfaces).\n2. Review and update static routes on all routers and firewalls to ensure correct routing to the remote-worker subnet and other production subnets.\n3. Consider implementing dynamic routing protocols (e.g., OSPF, EIGRP) to reduce reliance on static routes and improve network resilience.\n4. Implement proactive monitoring and alerting for critical interfaces and routing table changes.\n5. Regularly audit routing tables and interface statuses as part of routine maintenance.\n6. Update network diagrams and documentation to reflect current topology and routing configuration.\n7. Document the incident, RCA, and remediation steps for future reference and compliance.",
            "Tracking Next Steps": "- Review and update static routes on all routers and firewalls as per the RCA.\n- Consider implementing dynamic routing protocols to improve resilience.\n- Implement proactive monitoring for critical interfaces and routing tables.\n- Regularly audit routing tables and interface statuses.\n- Update network documentation to reflect current topology and configuration.\n- Document the incident, RCA, and remediation steps for future reference.",
            "Alarm Details": "**Alarm Details:**  \n- **Topology:**  \n  - The network consists of a remote-worker subnet (10.1.0.0/30) connected via the branch-router and branch firewall to the internal network (hosts: client1, client2, server).\n  - The branch-router interface GigabitEthernet0/1 connects the branch-router to the branch firewall and the rest of the internal network.\n  - Internal hosts are on separate subnets (10.0.2.10, 10.0.3.10, 10.0.4.10) and can communicate with each other.\n\n- **Logs & Key Events:**  \n  - Alarm triggered due to 100% packet loss between remote-worker subnet and all internal hosts.\n  - Investigation revealed branch-router interface Gi0/1 was administratively down, severing connectivity.\n  - Routing tables on branch-router, branch-fw, dmz-fw, client1-router, client2-router, and dmz-router were missing static routes for the remote-worker subnet, causing misrouting and blackholing of traffic.\n  - Remediation involved executing `no shutdown` on branch-router Gi0/1, restoring interface and connectivity.\n  - Post-remediation telemetry confirmed all hosts could ping each other with 0% packet loss.\n  - No static routes were added at this stage; issue resolved by interface restoration alone.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  - Outage was caused by a downed interface and missing static routes.\n  - Restoring the interface resolved the immediate issue.\n  - Recommendation to review and update static routes and consider dynamic routing for future resilience.",
            "Status": "Resolved",
            "Priority": "Low",
            "Insights": "Restoring the interface on the branch-router immediately resolved the connectivity issue, but the RCA also revealed missing static routes on multiple devices. While no further packet loss is observed, it is recommended to review and update static routes, consider implementing dynamic routing protocols for resilience, enhance monitoring for critical interfaces, and update network documentation to prevent future outages.",
            "Root Cause Analysis": "- The branch-router interface GigabitEthernet0/1 (connecting to the internal network) was administratively down, severing connectivity to the remote-worker subnet.\n- The branch-router routing table was missing static routes for production subnets; only a default route to the management subnet existed.\n- The branch-fw and dmz-fw lacked static or OSPF routes for the 10.1.0.0/30 (remote-worker) subnet, causing traffic to be misrouted and dropped.\n- Client1-router, client2-router, and dmz-router were also missing static routes for the 10.1.0.0/30 subnet, resulting in further misrouting.\n- The combination of the down interface and missing static routes led to all traffic to/from the remote-worker subnet being blackholed or misrouted, causing total loss of connectivity.",
            "Auto-Remediation Steps Taken": "- Brought up the administratively down interface (GigabitEthernet0/1) on the branch-router using the `no shutdown` command.",
            "Final Outcome": "Incident resolved; all connectivity restored after interface was brought up.",
            "Additional Insights/Recommendations": "- Review and update static routes on all routers and firewalls to prevent future routing blackholes.\n- Consider implementing dynamic routing protocols (e.g., OSPF, EIGRP) to reduce reliance on static routes and improve network resilience.\n- Implement proactive monitoring for critical interfaces to alert on administrative or operational down states.\n- Regularly audit routing tables and interface statuses as part of routine maintenance.\n- Update network diagrams and documentation to reflect current topology and routing configuration.\n- Document the incident, RCA, and remediation steps for future reference and compliance.",
