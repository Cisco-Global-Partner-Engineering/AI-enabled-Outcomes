**Title: Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Semantic Query Matching and Document Retrieval**

**Overview:**
- **Objective:** Enhance query response accuracy by leveraging advanced semantic matching and retrieval techniques.
- **Key Components:**
  - **Semantic Query Matching:** Uses a generative model to determine if two queries are semantically identical.
  - **BM25-Based Document Retrieval:** Utilizes BM25 algorithm for finding and ranking relevant documents.
  - **Contextual Answer Generation:** Synthesizes answers from the most relevant documents.

**Benefits:**
- **Improved Query Accuracy:** Ensures precise matching of user queries with cached responses.
- **Efficient Document Retrieval:** Quickly identifies and ranks relevant documents.
- **Contextual Relevance:** Generates answers based on the most contextually relevant information.

### Detailed Explanation of the Technique Used

**1. Semantic Query Matching:**

**File: `semanticchat.py`**

- **Function: `semanticcheck(query, cachedquery)`**
  - **Purpose:** Determines if two queries are semantically identical.
  - **Method:** 
    - Constructs a prompt asking if the two queries mean the same.
    - Uses a generative model (via `doquery.dochat`) to get a response.
    - Returns `True` if the response is "YES", otherwise `False`.

- **Function: `dbcheck(query, db)`**
  - **Purpose:** Checks if a query or its semantic equivalent exists in the database.
  - **Method:**
    - Retrieves all cached queries from the database.
    - Checks for an exact match first.
    - If no exact match, uses `semanticcheck` to find a semantically similar query.
    - Caches the result if a similar query is found.

**2. Document Retrieval Using BM25:**

**File: `vectorquery.py`**

- **BM25 Initialization:**
  - **Data Loading:** Loads questions from `data/doc_qa.json`.
  - **Tokenization:** Tokenizes the questions for BM25 processing.
  - **BM25 Setup:** Initializes BM25 with the tokenized corpus.

- **Function: `dosearch(query_question)`**
  - **Purpose:** Finds and ranks documents relevant to the query.
  - **Method:**
    - Tokenizes the query.
    - Computes BM25 scores for the query against the corpus.
    - Selects top 5 most similar questions based on BM25 scores.
    - Reorders the selected questions using a generative model (`dochat`).
    - Finds adjacent questions based on BM25 similarity.
    - Retrieves the content of the most relevant questions.
    - Constructs a prompt to generate an answer using the retrieved content.

**3. Pre-processing for Question Generation:**

**File: `pre-process.py`**

- **Function: `synthesize_questions_from_json(json_data, output_file)`**
  - **Purpose:** Generates questions from document content.
  - **Method:**
    - Reads and processes JSON content.
    - Constructs a prompt to generate a question for each content item.
    - Uses `dochat` to generate the question.
    - Saves the question and content pair to a JSON file.

**4. Supporting Functions:**

**File: `getquestions.py`**

- **Function: `getquestions(n=-1)`**
  - **Purpose:** Retrieves a list of questions from a JSON file.
  - **Method:** Reads the JSON file and extracts questions up to a specified limit.

### Advanced RAG Method Implementation

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**

- **Concept:** Combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to improve the accuracy and relevance of responses.
- **Implementation:**
  - **Retrieval Phase:** Uses BM25 to retrieve and rank relevant documents based on the query.
  - **Augmentation Phase:** Enhances the retrieved documents by finding adjacent questions and reordering them for contextual relevance.
  - **Generation Phase:** Uses a generative model to synthesize an answer from the most relevant documents.

**Benefits of RAG:**

- **Enhanced Accuracy:** By combining retrieval and generation, RAG ensures that responses are both relevant and contextually accurate.
- **Scalability:** Efficiently handles large datasets by leveraging BM25 for quick retrieval.
- **Contextual Understanding:** Generates answers that are contextually informed by the most relevant documents.
